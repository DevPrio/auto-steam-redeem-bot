# auto-steam-redeem-bot
This code is pretty outdated and also doesn't follow the guidelines of discord so I shut it down.

The bot is very dependant on [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
To put it simply, It starts off by opening tabs to have steam ready on the redeem page so instantly redeems the codes.

Q: How do I get the codes?
A: I've set the bot to join some discord servers where they drop steam codes and select the key drops channels.

After it's done an attempt to redeem a code it logs the output from steam including the message details that had the steam code in a channel that I've selected and also DMS me whether I got the 
game or not.
